## Tracy's ideas for User Stories

As a mentor can add students to the app. Information will include their name, school, and grade. If I know their coach(es) I want to add that too.

As a mentor I can update student information. I may need to add or remove a coach, or change their grade or school, for example.

As a mentor I need to save coach information in once and reference it where needed (for students). Coach information would include their name and email, and possibly sport coached.

As a mentor I need to create and update student scoring sheets. I want to pick a student from the list of my students, then click a button to add a new score sheet for that student.

As a mentor I must be able to update existing score sheets. Add comments at a later time, etc.

As a mentor I need to publish score sheets to Basecamp (or email them somewhere...) once I've completed them. I'll need indicators to show if score sheets have been completed and published.

As a mentor I need to be able to delete, or otherwise inactivate, students and coaches so they don't clutter up my home page. [inactivation would preserve the data for future reporting...]

As a RA executive I want an app that is easily accessible by mentors and streamlines their workflow.

As a coach, I want a weekly report of my student's earned playing time.

As a mentor I need to be able to override the playing time calculated by the scoring spreadsheet and have that value reflected in the coach's report.

As a mentor I want to know what tasks I have completed, and which I have yet to complete, for any given week. I'd like a visual indication that I have reports to publish, or student scoring to complete.
